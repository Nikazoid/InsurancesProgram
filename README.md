# node-express
A node-express example for learning puposes

In this project we use:
- Express.js, a very popular framework for Node.js applications.
- body-parser is used to parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the req.body property.
- Mongoose is a MongoDB object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment.
- Nodemon is a package that runs the node.js application and listen to any file change, updating the entire app.
- Concurrently allows us to run multiple npm commands at the same time
